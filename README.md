# DOAM
The Dynamic Order Analytics Module (DOAM) is a sophisticated data analysis program designed to monitor and analyze online customer order data in real-time. Utilizing advanced statistical algorithms, DOAM identifies significant deviations in product order volumes, pinpointing products that experience a sudden increase in orders even if they are not typical bestsellers. This system leverages both moving average calculations and time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA models) to detect these anomalies.		
". To detect products in online customer order data whose order volume suddenly increases significantly, even if they're not overall bestsellers, use statistical algorithms like calculating moving averages or employing time series analysis. 
. Choose two algorithem for anomaly detecting : ex) Moving Average and Standard Deviation, (2) Time Series Analysis (e.g., ARIMA)
  => choose right algorithm for anomaly detect
. Find similar results with the variables, thresholds for comparing the data.
. Define input parameter for query condition (compare date, period,..)
. Define output structure for handling the record data "
